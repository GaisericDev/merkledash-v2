                This section is aimed to get you started and provide guidelines on how to use the project. The primary goal
                of the project is to allow users to upload a list of sorts, and then retrieve the merkle proof and merkle root with the click of a button, or, an API call.
                <br></br><br></br>
                This project came to life after having to write code over and over for several NFT projects to compute the merkle root from a list. So if you want, you can make use of this tool and it will do a lot of work for you! &#128516;
