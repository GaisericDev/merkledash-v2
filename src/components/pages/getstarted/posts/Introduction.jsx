            Hi, glad to see you're reading this. This section is aimed to get you started and provide guidelines on how to use it. The primary goal
            of the project is to allow users to upload a list of sorts, and then retrieve the merkle proof and merkle root with the click of a button, or, an API call.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This project came to life after having to write code over and over for several NFT projects to compute the merkle root from a list, so perhaps others
            that are less inclined to code can make use of this.
